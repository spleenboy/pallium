This application use a specially-formatted project file to present you with one or more custom forms.</p>
<p>Because of its flexible project format, it can be used for multiple purposes.</p>
<h2 id="website-content-management">Website Content Management</h2>
<p>It makes a great light-weight <strong>content editor for websites</strong>. This was its original purpose, actually. Combine it with a static site generator, such as Jekyl, Sculpin or Wintersmith, and you&#39;ve got an easy to edit, static site on your hands. If you&#39;re reading this documentation in a browser, you&#39;re seeing the result of this workflow.</p>
<h2 id="note-taking">Note-taking</h2>
<p>Pallium uses your filesystem and plain text files as its source of content. It includes an easy-to-use Markdown editor. Set up a configuration file that uses a synchronized directory, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, and you have a great tool for quick note taking.</p>
<hr><h2>Project File Format</h2><p>A Pallium project file is just a specially-formatted JSON file that defines how Pallium should display and store JSON or YAML-formatted files.</p>
<h2 id="document-root">Document Root</h2>
<p>At the root of the project file, you&#39;ll include some general information and a <code>contentTypes</code> object, which defines all of the content types that will be included in your project. Optionally, you may include a <code>references</code> object, which is just a way of creating snippets for re-use across multiple <code>contentType</code> definitions.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Pallium Documentation&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Provide documentation for the Pallium application.&quot;,
  &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;redeem&quot;,
  &quot;contentDirectory&quot;: [&quot;content&quot;],
  &quot;assetDirectory&quot;: [&quot;content&quot;, &quot;assets&quot;],
  &quot;database&quot;: [&quot;content&quot;, &quot;index.db&quot;],
  &quot;references&quot;: {...},
  &quot;contentTypes&quot;: {...}
}
</code></pre><h3 id="title">title</h3>
<p>The title will identify your project.</p>
<h3 id="description">description</h3>
<p>This will appear below the title of your project on the home page of the Pallium app.</p>
<h3 id="icon">icon</h3>
<p>You may use any class name from <a href="https://design.google.com/icons/">Google&#39;s material design icon set</a> here.</p>
<h3 id="contentdirectory">contentDirectory</h3>
<p>This array indicates the path (relative to the project file) where files managed by the project will be stored. Because this is a cross-platform application, you should save each directory as a separate item in the array. The application will handle joining the directories together in the right way for the OS being used.</p>
<h3 id="assetdirectory">assetDirectory</h3>
<p>Like the <code>contentDirectory</code>, this is a relative path used to store any files uploaded to the project.</p>
<h3 id="database">database</h3>
<p>Pallium uses a embedded NoSQL database to store information about your project files. This set of relative directories and a file name tells Pallium where to save this database file.</p>
<h3 id="-references-references-"><a href="/pages/references">references</a></h3>
<p>References are an advanced feature that you may use to store snippets of JSON for reuse within the <code>contentTypes</code> object.</p>
<h3 id="-contenttypes-content-types-"><a href="/pages/content-types">contentTypes</a></h3>
<p>Each content type may have a different set of fields, storage settings and file format. If you&#39;re setting up a project for a blog, for example, you may have content types for posts, external links, static pages, etc.</p>
<hr><h2>References</h2><p>Whenever you what to use a reference instead of a value, you&#39;ll write <code>{&quot;reference&quot;: &quot;reference_key&quot;}</code>, where <code>reference_key</code> is the key you gave this snippet of JSON. For example, this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;references&quot;: {
    &quot;slug&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;required&quot;
      },
      {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;pattern&quot;,
        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;^[a-z\-]+$&quot;
      }
      ]
    }
  }
</code></pre><p>Will let you define a title field in a contentType like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;contentTypes&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;fields&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;url&quot;,
          &quot;label&quot;: &quot;URL&quot;,
          &quot;validation&quot;: {
            &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;slug&quot;
          }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre><hr></body></html>
