<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>Pallium Documentation</title></head><body><h1>Project File Format</h1><p>A Pallium project file is just a specially-formatted JSON file that defines how Pallium should display and store JSON or YAML-formatted files.</p>
<h2 id="document-root">Document Root</h2>
<p>At the root of the project file, you&#39;ll include some general information and a <code>contentTypes</code> object, which defines all of the content types that will be included in your project. Optionally, you may include a <code>references</code> object, which is just a way of creating snippets for re-use across multiple <code>contentType</code> definitions.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Pallium Documentation&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Provide documentation for the Pallium application.&quot;,
  &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;redeem&quot;,
  &quot;contentDirectory&quot;: [&quot;content&quot;],
  &quot;assetDirectory&quot;: [&quot;content&quot;, &quot;assets&quot;],
  &quot;database&quot;: [&quot;content&quot;, &quot;index.db&quot;],
  &quot;references&quot;: {...},
  &quot;contentTypes&quot;: {...}
}
</code></pre><h3 id="title">title</h3>
<p>The title will identify your project.</p>
<h3 id="description">description</h3>
<p>This will appear below the title of your project on the home page of the Pallium app.</p>
<h3 id="icon">icon</h3>
<p>You may use any class name from <a href="https://design.google.com/icons/">Google&#39;s material design icon set</a> here.</p>
<h3 id="contentdirectory">contentDirectory</h3>
<p>This array indicates the path (relative to the project file) where files managed by the project will be stored. Because this is a cross-platform application, you should save each directory as a separate item in the array. The application will handle joining the directories together in the right way for the OS being used.</p>
<h3 id="assetdirectory">assetDirectory</h3>
<p>Like the <code>contentDirectory</code>, this is a relative path used to store any files uploaded to the project.</p>
<h3 id="database">database</h3>
<p>Pallium uses a embedded NoSQL database to store information about your project files. This set of relative directories and a file name tells Pallium where to save this database file.</p>
<h3 id="-references-references-"><a href="/pages/references">references</a></h3>
<p>References are an advanced feature that you may use to store snippets of JSON for reuse within the <code>contentTypes</code> object.</p>
<h3 id="-contenttypes-content-types-"><a href="/pages/content-types">contentTypes</a></h3>
<p>Each content type may have a different set of fields, storage settings and file format. If you&#39;re setting up a project for a blog, for example, you may have content types for posts, external links, static pages, etc.</p>
