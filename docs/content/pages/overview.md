### Website Content Management
It makes a great light-weight **content editor for websites**. This was its original purpose, actually. Combine it with a static site generator, such as Jekyl, Sculpin or Wintersmith, and you've got an easy to edit, static site on your hands. If you're reading this documentation in a browser, you're seeing the result of this workflow.

### Note-taking
Pallium uses your filesystem and plain text files as its source of content. It includes an easy-to-use Markdown editor. Set up a configuration file that uses a synchronized directory, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, and you have a great tool for quick note taking.
